# scaling-robot

A random repository for Seb and Kenny's class

This is my first alteration.

Scaling is over-rated.

Robots are too.

The robot scales up and down depending on the size of the following objects:

* door frames
* size of tree that it is climbing
* size of the room
* whether it is eating a taco or burrito
